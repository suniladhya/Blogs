Our happiness is in our own hands. Yet, rather than looking within, people tend to seek happiness from external sources like money, gadgets and
relationships. Lasting happiness will never come from these things over which we have no control – it can only come from inside. To sustain happiness, we
must stay grounded in the present and have a positive outlook on the world. We must cultivate gratitude. In order to overcome our instinctive 
survival-related fears, we should plan and focus on realistic future goals that provide sustainable happiness in our personal and professional lives. 
By focusing on well-being and personal fulfillment, rather than wealth and power, we can work toward seeing the beauty around us and achieving peace and
happiness.
