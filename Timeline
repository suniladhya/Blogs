# Every Individual have thier own time line. 
They live in a certain way, Improve at their own pace, The time plays a key role in their life.

Inshort every one has their own timeline and priority defined.
The time zoe one lives  in, may seem minuscle to the otehr person.

but the real truth is the Individual is pretty musch involved in achieving own Institution

I consider Human being as an institution. They Live and make them loud at their comfort level.

The Apple, Steve Jobs live for a short time. It may appear from a nay- sayer, 
But to him alone he has lived and survivef million years. As per his achievement and inventions, It could have taken several years of time 
of multiple creative thinkers. And There comes he, who has enough credibility and enthusiasm to achieve what he wants to achieve.

Nothing can Hold you back if you want to Roll yourself to Zenith
