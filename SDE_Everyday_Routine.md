I often fantasise about a good routine for software engineers, and how to train it. I am close to doing this, but not as close as I'd like.

This is not complete, but all of it is grounded in experience and studies.

Morning:

Mild physical exercise: stretching and some cardio (swimming is great for me), to increase circulation to the brain
Warming up the brain: code katas, maybe logical problems or chess can work
Remember the goals for the day (as defined last evening, see below)
During the day:

Work in increments. Based on my experience, a modified pomodoro works best: 90′ work sessions + 15′ break in the morning, 45′ + 10′ in the afternoon
Lunch: small and healthy. Mostly vegetables, fish, or grilled meat. They keep the brain focused, unlike carbs and sugar
A power nap (15–30′)
Before end of day:

Review accomplishments
Write down the goals and todos for next day
After end of work:

Unwind your brain. Long walks or swimming work for me, but find your own thing
Go to sleep early, even if you're reading in bed.
